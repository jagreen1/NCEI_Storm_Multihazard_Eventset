# NCEI_Storm_Multihazard_Eventset
This repository contains scripts that allows the user to clean NOAA NCEI's Storm Events Database, and generate a custom multihazard eventset.

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first publically avaliable Multihazard Eventset specific to the United States.

The formatting has been designed in a manner similar to the MYRIAD-HESA multihazard eventset developed by Judith Claassen.
