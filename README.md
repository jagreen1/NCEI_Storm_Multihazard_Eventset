# NCEI_Storm_Multihazard_Eventset
This repository contains scripts that allows the user to clean NOAA NCEI's Storm Events Database, and generate a custom multihazard eventset using a defined timelag overlap and event type / impact threshold filters.

The input database files necessary to run these scripts can be downloaded via HTML/FTP on the NCEI website at the below URL (as of Mar 2025).

- https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/
- ftp://ftp.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/

To the best of my knowledge, this is the first publically avaliable Multihazard Eventset specific to the United States.

The formatting has been designed in a manner similar to the MYRIAD-HESA multihazard eventset developed by Judith Claassen.
